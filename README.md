# HashiTalks 2023

This repository holds the presentation for HashiTalks 2023.  
The presentation is in MarkDown and presented with [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides).  
Note that the markup in the presentation was scaled to be presented in a `16:9` based terminal and has been styled with some of the product colors of HashiCorp. This can be seen in the specific headings size table below:
  
| Heading | Product   |
| ------- | --------- |
| One     | Packer    |
| Two     | Nomad     |
| Three   | Vault     |
| Four    | Consul    |
| Five    | Waypoint  |
| Six     | Terraform |
